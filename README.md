# A-Fake-Product-Identification-System

## Idea we Got From :)
In recent years, counterfeiting plays an important role in the product manufacturing industries. it affects company name, sales, business profit. So we decided to create an app that helps identify real products and detect fake products using emerging technologies. Blockchain technology is a distributed, decentralized digital ledger that stores transaction information in the form of blocks connected to the chain. Blockchain technology is immutable, i.e. data is stored. once in the chain cannot be hacked or modified, so customers or users do not need to rely on third-party users to confirm product authenticity.


## Problem Statement :)
A Fake Product Identification Systems may be prolonged overdue, A imperative factor of Failure and more than one Counterfeits of Fake Products because of Intermediaries makes it tough for the consumers to determine whether or not the product is authentic or not.

Our goal is to keep the Authenticity of the product and acts as single point of product authentication among the consumers.

## What it does :)
Blockchain is a new technology that works in a decentralized manner, making it easy to reach consensus. Our team decided to work on a project that gives Manufacturers the right to create their own assets that return a unique cryptographic hash and generate a unique QR code that contains the asset details and unique hash value of asset.

Distributor will simply sign in themselves at the platform, then no in addition functionalities is supplied to the distributor, after the producer create the asset he/she assign the registered distributor along side it, then the distributor receives the mail concerning the equal to supply the order.

## How we built it :)
After going through multiple methodologies and techniques used in the market to ensure authenticity of a product . We came up with a decentralized solution to authenticate the products whether they are real or fake. One of the reasons behind opting for a decentralized system is that it is immutable, so there are no chances of tampering the data and they are public, so there is nothing like secrecy. As it will provide complete transparency to the users, manufactures, vendors and others.

We next studied about the supply chain to find the requirements and to decide upon the workflow from the manufacturer to the customer. we then created the structure of the smart contracts which will create a single manufacturer which will then accept multiple distributors and will consist of different entities: -Manufacturer -Distributor -Customer. The contract deployer will be made the manufacturer and the rest distributors and customers. Metamask was then integrated with the website and based on the metamask contact address the nature of the user is decided. Only the deployer can open the Manufacturer part which is determined by the users contact address while the distributor and customer part of the website can be accessed by anyone.

## May be we face some Challenges :)
We had difficulties along the way because we had to start from scratch at first because we knew nothing about ReactJs. Learn the fundamentals of React Js along the way. Additionally, we needed to display smart contracts on the XDC network yet we lacked solidity language proficiency. We had to spend additional time learning about the solidity as a result. A variety of materials were used, but Udemy and YouTube received the most attention. React was mostly used for front-end development, whereas Solidity smart contracts were used for back-end development. We utilised the WEB3 plug-in to connect the backend and frontend. After extensive study, we learned how to link a Metamask account to deploy our smart contract.

## Requirements :)
html, css, js, react, solidity
