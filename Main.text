In recent years,
counterfeiting plays an important role in the product manufacturing industries. 
it affects company name, sales, business profit. So we decided to create an app that helps identify real products and detect fake products using emerging technologies. Blockchain technology is a distributed, decentralized digital ledger that stores transaction information in the form of blocks connected to the chain. Blockchain technology is immutable, i.e. data is stored.
once in the chain cannot be hacked or modified, so customers or users do not need to rely on third-party users to confirm product authenticity
